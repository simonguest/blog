title: Writing Better Technical Documents
created: 1/1/2022
synopsis: In this article, I share five areas that have helped me become a better writer of technical documents. I explore telling a story, creating a consistent style, striving for clarity, using feedback loops, and practicing every day.

Since joining Code.org, I've been asked on over one occasion what habits at Amazon I would like to continue in my new role here. While Amazon has many "peculiar" qualities, the one I valued most during my time there was the culture of writing.

A culture of writing has many benefits. A good document makes meetings more efficient. Spending the first ten minutes reading a well-written document gets everyone on the same page (both literally and figuratively) much quicker than any slide deck will. A good document also increases critical thinking. It's possible to "wing" a presentation with a few bullet points assembled the night before. You can't do that with a good document, and instead must invest the time exploring many angles of a topic before you can put it into words.

Writing, however, can be hard. Coming from an engineering background, writing wasn't (and still isn't) as natural to me as other subjects. To help me as I’ve been on this journey over the past few years, I compiled a list of resources, which I'd like to share here.

# Telling a Story

A well-written document tells a story. Storytelling isn't exclusive to fiction writing. A good technical document can still have a protagonist, conflict, and a story-based narrative.

For documents I write, I try to start by putting myself in the reader's position. What is the point of contention that the reader should understand first? What are they expecting next? What's the plot twist that eventually leads to the proposal?

Two books that have helped me understand this are [Story](https://smile.amazon.com/Story-Structure-Substance-Principles-Screenwriting-ebook/dp/B0042FZVOY) by Robert McKee and [On Writing](https://smile.amazon.com/Writing-Memoir-Craft-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B000FC0SIM) by Stephen King. While it's in depth and aimed at screenwriters, Story provides many of the basic constructs for good storytelling. King's book is a unique and engaging perspective on becoming a writer. While it's more geared towards fiction writers, much of the content can apply to writing technical documents.

# Consistent Style

Inconsistencies are easy to spot as a reader and notoriously difficult to see when you are writing. Yet, such inconsistencies - using 3rd Jan in one paragraph and 1/3 in the next - will negatively affect how your document is received, even if the content is good.

During my time at Amazon, I created a style guide that I used for documents I was writing or reviewing in my team. This style guide contains rules that try to ensure consistency throughout a document. For example, my date rule is to use "3 Jan" vs. "1/3" for days and "Jan 2022" vs. "1/2022" for months. For large numbers, I have a rule to use "102M" vs. "102 million" or "102m".

Building your own style guide is easy. I'd recommend starting with [Elements of Style](https://smile.amazon.com/Elements-Style-William-Strunk-Jr/dp/1989862004) by William Strunk Jr. to learn about common patterns used in books and other documents. As you get more in depth, I've found the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://smile.amazon.com/Chicago-Manual-Style-17th/dp/022628705X) by The University of Chicago Press Editorial Staff an invaluable resource for those documents that have to be perfect.

# Striving for Clarity

When writing documents on technical subjects, it's easy to slip into a mode of writing that biases towards overly complex jargon. The illusion is that doing so will make you sound much smarter, but I've found the opposite to be true. Instead of writing a document that your professor would be proud of, try writing in a style that an 8th grader could read (even if they couldn't understand the technical concepts).

One habit that can immediately help is writing in the active voice. It wasn't until I took some writing classes at Amazon that I discovered I was writing mostly in the passive voice ("The code is optimized to be secure.") vs. an active voice ("I've optimized the code to be secure."). I've found several tools (e.g., [ProWritingAid](https://prowritingaid.com/)) that have prevented these creeping back in.

Other books I would recommend include [Sense of Style](https://smile.amazon.com/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing-ebook/dp/B00INIYG74) by Steven Pinker. Pinker covers an almost scientific approach for writing clearly and avoiding what he calls an "academic" style. I also like [On Writing Well](https://smile.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548) by William Zinsser. When I started writing, I found that many of my documents were too long. One recommendation in Zinsser's book is to reduce your prose by 50% and when you've done that, try to reduce it again by another 50%. When I've used this with my teams, I've seen many technical proposals distill down to the essence of the message.

# Using Feedback Loops

Don't shy away from getting feedback on your writing. Writing is a journey of continual improvement and you should welcome all feedback.

There are many automated ways of generating feedback for your documents. I've had success with [ProWritingAid](https://prowritingaid.com/) for the platforms I use, but most editors now support some basic style and grammar checking. Once you have incorporated all the feedback from automated tools, ask other folks to review your work, especially ahead of an important meeting. When they provide feedback, focus on the areas they flagged as confusing and think about how you can clarify these. Maybe it requires a stronger introduction or purpose? Maybe you are using acronyms that the audience is less familiar with?

In addition, be a supportive reviewer for other writers on your team. At Amazon, when folks would send me documents to review, I would split my feedback into two parts: I’d cover the proposal (i.e., Let's first discuss whether the idea makes sense) and then the writing style (i.e., I have some feedback on the grammar and structure of the document if it is useful.) On every occasion I asked this question, I found it was well received.

# Practicing Every Day

Every time you type something is an opportunity to become a better writer. Putting together a quick email? Maybe that's a chance to check for passive voice? Composing a LinkedIn post? How could that be more concise?

Finally, besides practice, I've found that over the years, reading has made me a better writer. I try to always have a queue of books lined up to read from a variety of fields.

My advice? Read a lot. Look at the different styles that authors use. How did the author structure the work? Scan for inconsistencies. What don't you like about an article? You'll be amazed at what you can pick up through reading the work of others.
