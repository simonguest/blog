synopsis: In this article, I share five areas that have helped me become a better writer of technical documents. I explore telling a story, maintaining a consistent style, striving for clarity, using feedback loops, and practicing every day.

Since joining Code.org, several folks have asked me what habits at Amazon I plan to bring across to my new role here. While Amazon has many [peculiar](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/becoming-peculiar-amazonian-way-kvon-tucker-m-s-i-o/) qualities, the one I valued most was the culture of writing. As you've likely heard, Amazon values writing and using documents for decision making over creating slide decks.

A culture of writing has many benefits. A good document makes meetings more efficient. Spending the first ten minutes reading a well-written document gets everyone on the same page (both literally and figuratively) much quicker than any slide deck can. A good document also increases critical thinking skills. While it's possible to "wing" a presentation by assembling a few bullet points the night before, the same isn't true with a good document. You must instead invest the time exploring many angles of a topic before you can confidently put it into words.

Writing, however, can be hard. Coming from an engineering background, writing wasn't (and still isn't) as natural to me as other subjects. To help, over the past few years, I've found five areas important considerations when writing technical documents. Here they are:

# Telling a Story

Storytelling isn't just for works of fiction. A well-written technical document can still tell a story. The proposal for your next big idea can still have a protagonist, conflict, and a story-based narrative.

When applying this to technical documents, I start by putting myself in the reader's position. Who is the protagonist that I want to present to the reader? What is the issue or conflict that the protagonist faces? How will they resolve this? Many of the promotion documents I wrote at Amazon followed this format. The protagonist was of course the individual being put up for promotion, and I shared the conflicts and issues they faced along the way (which later on became the justification for moving to the next level). While it didn't read like a novel, I was able to use story constructs to create a compelling case.

Two books that have helped me learn more about storytelling are [*Story* by Robert McKee](https://smile.amazon.com/Story-Structure-Substance-Principles-Screenwriting-ebook/dp/B0042FZVOY) and [*On Writing* by Stephen King](https://smile.amazon.com/Writing-Memoir-Craft-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B000FC0SIM). While it's in depth and aimed at screenwriters, McKee's book provides the foundation for good storytelling. On the other hand, King's memoir is a unique and engaging perspective on becoming a writer. While it's geared more towards fiction writers, I found much of the content still applies to writing non-fiction work.

# Maintaining a Consistent Style

Inconsistencies are easy to spot as a reader and notoriously difficult to see when you are writing. Yet, inconsistencies such as using *3rd Jan* in one paragraph and *1/3* in the next will negatively affect how your document is received, even if the content is sound.

During my time at Amazon, I created a style guide that I referred to when writing or reviewing documents. This style guide is a set of rules to ensure consistency throughout a document. For example, my rule for dates is to use *3 Jan* vs. *1/3* for days and *Jan 2022* vs. *1/2022* for months. I have many other rules that include the use of numbers, use of acronyms, referencing other materials, and so on.

Building your own style guide is easy. I'd recommend starting with [*Elements of Style* by William Strunk Jr.](https://smile.amazon.com/Elements-Style-William-Strunk-Jr/dp/1989862004)  to learn about common patterns used in the publishing industry. As you get deeper into the subject, the [*Chicago Manual of Style* by The University of Chicago Press Editorial Staff](https://smile.amazon.com/Chicago-Manual-Style-17th/dp/022628705X) an invaluable resource for those documents that have to be perfect.

# Striving for Clarity

When writing a document on a technical subject, it's easy to use a writing style that biases towards overly complex jargon. The illusion is that doing so will make you sound much smarter, but I've found quite the opposite to be true. Instead of writing a document that your professor would be proud of, try writing in a style that an 8th grader could read (even if they wouldn't necessarily understand the underlying concept).

One habit that can help increase this clarity is writing in the active voice. It wasn't until I took a writing class at Amazon that I discovered I was writing mostly in the passive voice (i.e., The code is optimized to be secure) vs. an active voice (i.e., I've optimized the code to be secure). I now use several tools (e.g., [ProWritingAid](https://prowritingaid.com/)) that prevent too many of these creeping back in.

Other books I would recommend include [*Sense of Style* by Steven Pinker](https://smile.amazon.com/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing-ebook/dp/B00INIYG74). Pinker covers an almost scientific approach for writing clearly and avoiding leaning too heavily towards an academic style. I also enjoyed [*On Writing Well* by William Zinsser](https://smile.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548). One recommendation in Zinsser's book is after you've completed your first draft, try to reduce the length of your prose by 50%. And once you've done that, try to reduce it again by another 50%. When I've used this approach with my own documents, it's been a useful tool to identify the filler and distill down to the essence of what I'm wanting to say.

# Using Feedback Loops

Don't shy away from asking for feedback on your writing. Writing is a journey of continual improvement and constructive feedback will help your documents become stronger.

There are many automated ways of generating feedback for your documents. I've had success with [*ProWritingAid*](https://prowritingaid.com/), especially as it integrates well with Google Docs, but most editors now support basic style and grammar checking. Once you have addressed feedback from automated tools, ask other folks on your team to review your work, especially ahead of an important review. When they provide feedback, I recommend focusing on the areas they flag as confusing and think   about how you can clarify these. Maybe it requires a stronger introduction or purpose? Maybe it's the length of the paragraphs? Maybe you are using acronyms that the reader is less familiar with?

In addition, be a supportive reviewer for other writers on your team. At Amazon, when folks would send me documents to review, I would split my feedback into two parts: Iâ€™d cover the proposal (i.e., Let's first discuss whether the idea makes sense) and then the writing style (i.e., I have some feedback on the grammar and structure of the document if it is useful.) On every occasion I shared feedback on the document's style, I found it was well received.

# Practicing Every Day

Every time you put hands to keyboard is an opportunity to become a better writer. Putting together a quick email? Maybe that's a chance to check for passive voice? Composing a LinkedIn post? How could that be more concise? It may take longer to create and review what used to be a single email in lower case, but doing so can help form natural habits that will make writing longer documents easier.

Finally, besides practice, I've found that reading has made me a better writer. I try to always have a queue of books lined up, and even if they are deeply technical, it's always fascinating to see how the author introduces the subject and keeps me, the reader, engaged.
